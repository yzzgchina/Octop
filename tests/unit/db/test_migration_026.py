"""Migration 026: expert-team runs, task findings, and task/artifact columns.

``team_runs`` is the 1:1 extension row of the project a team run owns -- it is not a
second project entity, so ``project_id`` is ``NOT NULL UNIQUE ... ON DELETE CASCADE``
(1:1 and same-lifetime, matching ``project_tasks.project_id``). Added are four tables
(``team_runs`` / ``team_run_phases`` / ``team_run_members`` / ``project_task_findings``),
thirteen ``project_tasks`` columns, two ``project_artifacts`` columns and one ``threads``
column. All additive -- no table rebuild, no ``migrate.py`` helper.

The "at most one lead per run" rule is a PARTIAL UNIQUE INDEX; a partial predicate is
not expressible as an inline table constraint in either dialect, so it is emitted as a
separate ``CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... WHERE is_lead = 1``.
