"""Project discussion line — plan T3.1 (the first half of the 双层模型).

The plan splits a project's collaboration record in two layers:

* the **discussion line** — free-form ``project_comments``, on a project or on one
  of its tasks (this module), and
* the **requirement layer** — typed ``requirement_nodes`` distilled out of it
  (T3.2, not implemented here).

A comment is written either by a person (dashboard) or by an agent during a task
turn, which is what ``author_type`` and ``source`` record. ``task_id`` is the
soft link onto a task's line: it carries no database foreign key, so the repo
checks it at write time and a comment can never attach to another project's task.

Permission logic is deliberately **not** re-implemented here. :class:`ProjectService`
owns the §4.6 matrix, so every entry point delegates to its
:meth:`~octop.infra.projects.service.ProjectService.assert_project_role`.
