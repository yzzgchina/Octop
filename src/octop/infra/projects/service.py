"""Project domain service — lifecycle, knowledge-base binding, permissions.

Three responsibilities beyond the repos (plan T2.1):

1. **Knowledge-base lifecycle.** A project owns one KB whose name mirrors the
   project name. Creation is a multi-step, cross-repo flow, and the repos each
   open their own transaction — there is no shared transaction to roll back.
   Every failure therefore runs an explicit **compensating delete** so we never
   leave a project without its KB, or a KB without its project.
2. **State machines.** Projects: ``draft -> active -> (paused|completed|cancelled)
   -> archived`` (PLAN.md §3.1); ``archived`` is terminal and makes the project
   read-only. Tasks: seven states with ``planning`` as the entry state (§1.2).
3. **Permission matrix** (plan §4.6) behind :meth:`ProjectService.assert_project_role`.

Task dispatch (plan T2.5) hangs off the same service — :meth:`ProjectService.dispatch_task`
owns the task write and the timeline row, while the turn itself lives in
:mod:`octop.infra.projects.dispatch` and reuses cron's extracted delivery path.

Membership is the only way in: a platform admin who is not a project member is
rejected like anyone else. The coarse ``projects`` permission key gates "may use
the project feature"; the ``project_members`` join gates the data.
