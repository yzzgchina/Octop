-- Schema v23: who adopted a project comment as the conclusion.
--
-- Canonical v22 -> v23 DDL for PostgreSQL. Executed statement-by-statement by
-- ``_apply_postgresql_migration`` (split on ";\n"), so every statement must be
-- self-contained. ``IF NOT EXISTS`` guards keep a re-run safe; ``migrate.py``
-- gains no ``_ensure_*`` helper for this version.
--
-- Two nullable TEXT columns on ``project_comments``; NULL means "not the
-- conclusion" or "adopted before this column existed".
--
-- Timestamp-free by design: the mark's own lifetime is the comment row's.
